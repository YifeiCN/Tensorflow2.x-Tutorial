## Motivation

I have been learning and using Tensorflow2 for about eight months,  when the Tensorflow2 was just released.  For advanced education and recommendation of my tutor, I studied cs231n last fall, and in assignment2 of this course I choose Tensorflow2.

I don't wanna introduce how good Tensorflow2 is. I just wanna sort out what I have learned so that I can use it later quickly. And I'd be honored if anyone else felt that they had benefited.
